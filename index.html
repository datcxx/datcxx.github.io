      <p><b>Why not Rust?</b></p>
      <p><i>There is a <a href="http://github.com/datrs">Rust</a> version, use it.</i></p>
      <br/>
      <p><b>Why C++17/2a?</b></p>
      <p><i>The other option is Rust.</i></p>
      <br/>
      <p><b>Why a custom build-system/package-manager?</b></p>
      <p><i>Tools that solve problems you don't have slow down your productivity.
        C++ build tools and package managers are often separate concerns that try
        to solve an ambitious number of use cases &mdash; most of which are not
        relevant to this project. Getting them to function in concert compounds
        their complexity and becomes distracting.</i></p>
      <br/>
      <p><b>Will I need to use this build-system/package-manager in my project?</b></p>
      <p><i>No. The finished product is a static or shared library that
        can be used without needing to care about how this project is
        structured internally.</i></p>
      <br/>
      <p><b>Can I contribute to this project?</b></p>
      <p><i>Yes! We are looking for maintainers &mdash; specifically you. You're
        a particularly good engineer and we would love to work with you. &#10084;</i></p>
      <br/>
      <p><b>Where can I learn more about how DAT works?</b></p>
      <p><i><a href="https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/">This</a> is
        a great place to start. But you can also follow
        <a href="https://github.com/datproject/dat-node/">this</a> dependency
        tree.</i></p>
